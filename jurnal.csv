The explanatory role of spirituality","http://ijere.iaescore.com/index.php/IJERE/article/view/20455","In two studies, we intend to investigate whether spirituality can explain the relationship between intrinsic religious orientation (IRO) and emotional intelligence (EI). Seventy-three worshipping houses-going adults, aged 18-56, had participated in the study. Data was collected by employing Intrinsic Scale of Religious Orientation Scale, Spirituality Assessment Scale, and the Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test. Our first study discovered that IRO is not a significant predictor of EI. Nevertheless, Bootstrap analysis with 5000 samples and 95% interval confidence indicated that spirituality fully mediated the link between intrinsic religious orientation and emotional intelligence in our second study. In other words, without high level of spirituality one’s religious orientation does not significantly predict their emotional intelligence. Limitation and suggestion are discussed at the end of the paper."

Performed analysis gived perspective on the learning opportunities offered in classroom instruction for building mathematical competencies specified in the current state education curriculum. The results indicate that the selection of tasks was not in accordance with the curriculum requirements. Mostly, teachers used close-ended, non-applicative, lower-level cognitive tasks presented in symbolic form, promoting operations and calculations as a central activity. These types of tasks are usually associated with knowledge and skills of lower orders. In this case, classroom instruction had low potential and very little room left to build a significant portion of competencies and learning outcomes of higher orders."

In this study, a robotics project was conducted to close the gap of students’ difficulty in relating the theoretical concepts of programming and real-world problems. Hence, an experiential learning approach using the Kolb model was proposed to investigate the problem. In this project, students were split into groups whereby they were asked to develop codes for controlling the navigation of a wheeled mobile robot. They were responsible for managing their group’s activities, conducting laboratory tests, producing technical reports and preparing a video presentation. The statistical analysis performed on the students’ summative assessments of a programming course revealed a remarkable improvement in their problem-solving skills and ability to provide programming solutions to a real-world problem."

Despite this, Region 8 (like other non-Tagalog speaking Regions) lacks primary texts in the mother tongue, vocabulary lists, grammar lessons and, more fundamentally, the references needed for educators to create these materials. To fill this void, the researchers created a 377,930-word language corpus generated from 419 distinct Waray texts, which led to frequency word lists, a five-language classified dictionary, a 1,000-word reference dictionary with pioneering part-of-speech tagging, and software for determining the grade level of Waray texts. These outputs are intended to be “best practices” models for other Regions. Accordingly, the researchers also created open-source, customizable software for compiling and grade-leveling texts, analyzing the grammatical nuances of each local language, and producing vocabulary lists and other materials for the Grade 1-3 classroom.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.11591/ijere.v3i1.5862"

One of the most important things is the adjustment in the learning model. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of blended learning as an alternative to online education in the new normal era. This study uses a quantitative approach to compare educational programs' effectiveness before implementing blended learning with the point of educational programs after implementing blended learning conducted at SMA N 1 Piyungan in the Special Region of Yogyakarta. There are three in this research. First, so far, the problems in learning before the Blandet learning model were held, students had many difficulties. In terms of teacher and student, readiness was still minimal, unorganized, and untrained, so it was only natural that learning results were considered ineffective. Second, the facilities and infrastructure owned by the school, teachers, and students are inadequate; not entirely students can have the facilities expected from the school, making it challenging to learn Blended learning. The sampling technique used was a questionnaire technique, in which the respondents involved in this study were teachers who were taken from the schools that were the research sites. The number of respondents involved in this study was 70 teachers who were determined using the Slovin formula. The data collection technique used in this study used a questionnaire technique. The data analysis used in this study was mathematical analysis, which compared the percentage between educational programs' effectiveness before implementing blended learning with the point of educational programs after implementing blended learning. The assessment criteria are high whenever they have a score of 80-100% s, while the requirements are moderate, the score is 70-78%.

It was found that anthropogenic activity had a significant contribution to the lake’s pollution. Nine species of six aquatic plant families were found in the lake. The survey revealed that the lake was feasible as a learning resource with criteria easy to access, safety, time efficiency, costs, and the material's suitability for EB courses. The t-test showed a difference in the students’ scores between before and after exploration practices. These findings suggest that Lake Tempe can serve as a resource for CTL in EB courses."

The study used causal comparative research type of non-experimental design. The sample consisted of 5,076 public senior secondary school examinees (SSS3) between the age of 14-16 years from 45 schools, which were drawn randomly from three senatorial districts of Osun State, Nigeria. Instrument used for this study was 2018 Osun State unified multiple-choice mathematics achievement test items with empirical reliability coefficient of 0.82. Data obtained were analysed using Non-linear factor analysis, Stout’s Test of Essential Unidimensionality (STEU), Factor Analysis (FA), Full Information Factor Analysis (FIFA) and Bootstrap Modified Parallel Analysis Test (BMPAT). Results showed that both the BMPAT and STEU ascertained violation of unidimensionality assumption of the test items (the observed difference in the second eigenvalue of the observed data and that of second eigenvalue of the simulated data was statistically significant, p = 0.0099; Stout’s test rejected the assumption of essential unidimensionality, T = 10.6260, p<0.05). Non-linear factor analysis and full information factor analysis revealed that four dimensions embedded in the test items and loadings of the items showed within-item multidimensionality respectively. The authors’ concluded that modeling examinees’ performance with unidimensional model when it was actually multidimensional in nature would affect performance of examinees adversely and could lead to blur judgment. Consequently, it is recommended that unidimensional scoring method of Osun State unified mathematics achievement test implicit in Classical Test Theory should be jettisoned and an appropriate scoring model (multidimensional) should be embraced."

In this regard, the anchoring vignette approach was introduced against the biases, correcting individuals’ self-rated responses based on their rating of hypothetical individuals in the scenario. Drawing from students’ self-rated social and emotional skills in mathematics, this paper presented the study which examined the effect of anchoring vignette approach on reliability and correlation by comparing self-rated and vignette-corrected scales. Research participants were Mongolian students in ninth grade (N=308). The participants were administered in two scales: self-ratings for math perseverance and cooperative learning in math, followed by a vignette set. The vignette-corrected scale showed higher reliability than the self-rating scale for both math perseverance and cooperative learning in math. Besides, the vignette-corrected scales for gender and region showed a stronger and more significant correlation than the self-rating scales, suggesting that there might be gender- and region-related differences in the way the students act in math class. In summary, these findings suggest that the anchoring vignette approach has the potential to measure social and emotional or non-cognitive aspects of mathematics in a more reliable way. Future studies could further investigate the reliability and validity of the anchoring vignette approach by including more cultural groups and designing the vignettes while considering various math contents and vignette gender."

It is therefore well accepted in the education literature that, testing is an important element of education. To effectively utilize the tests in educational policies and quality assurance its validity and reliability estimates are necessary. There are two generally acceptable frameworks used in evaluating the quality of test in educational and psychological measurements, these are; Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Item Response Theory (IRT). The estimates of test items validity and reliability depend on a particular measurement model used. It is vital for a test developer to be familiar with the different test development and item analysis methods in order to facilitate the development of a new test. The CTT is a traditional approach which was widely criticise in the measurement community for its shortcomings such as sample dependency of coefficient measures and estimates of measurement error. However, the IRT is a modern approach which provides solutions to most of the CTT’s identified shortcomings. This paper therefore, provides a comprehensive overview of the IRT and its procedures as applied to test item development and analysis. The paper concludes with some suggestions for test developers and test specialists at all levels to adopt IRT for its identified crucial theoretical and empirical gains over CTT. IRT based parameter estimates should be superior and reliable than CTT based parameter estimates. With these features, IRT can help resolve the problems associated with test design based on CTT."

The Paradox of International Faculty Migration to Moroccan Universities","http://ijere.iaescore.com/index.php/IJERE/article/view/22435","This study seeks to highlight key motivational influences for international faculty self-initiated expatriation (SIE) from developed to developing countries. We use the North African country of Morocco as a case illustration. While previous research has focused extensively on south-to-north migration, scant attention has been given to the migration of academic faculty from developed to developing regions despite the increasing level of activity in this area. Against this backdrop, this study provides fresh insights into the push and pulls factors—notably the motivations, expectations, and experiences of faculty who have embarked upon this type of mobility and drawing upon the theoretical lens of SIE. The study revealed that non-economic factors, namely ‘gaining international experience’, ‘raising academic status’ and ‘greater employment opportunities’ are the most important pull factors to migrate while ‘lack of career opportunities’, ‘unsatisfied job’ and ‘underemployment’ are the push factors that influence faculty self-initiated expatriation to Morocco. Our study showed 53.1% overall job satisfaction among expatriates while literature reported unsatisfactory career development and work conditions among local university teachers. Findings attested that expatriate women, in the large majority (89.3%), were unsatisfied with their current job while, on the contrary, men are globally contented (68%). Active local professional network seems to have a significant correlation with expatriate men’s job satisfaction."

The purpose of this study is to analyze students' errors in translating from symbolic representations to verbal and graphic representations. This research was descriptive study with qualitative approach. Tests are given to junior high school students. From the results of data analysis, it is obtained that in translating from symbolic to verbal forms (problems in daily life) that are following the given system of equations, students are still unable to make representations correctly. When students are asked to translate into graphical form, students are still unable to draw complete graphs and errors made by students are misinterpretation and implementation errors, so they cannot maintain the semantic congruence between source representation and target representation. Based on this, it is necessary to make a learning plan that can improve students’ ability to translate between representations."

The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of parents’ attitude, preferences towards sexuality education (SE) and factors that contributed to their attitudes and perceptions based on review of relevant literature. The articles were retrieved via electronic databases, and manually examined to identify the studies that addressed the research questions. There were 29 studies with a total of 22,213 parents involved which published in peer-reviewed journals between the year 2000 and 2018 were selected and reviewed systematically. The findings emerged from the review were categorized into three main themes which included parental attitudes, parental preferences towards the implementation of SE and the factors contributed to their attitudes and perceptions. Most studies revealed that parents showed positive attitudes and support the inclusion of SE in school. They preferred age-appropriated SE to be introduced in elementary schools and secondary schools. Some parents supported SE which is aligned with religious teaching and cultural. Demographic factors, parents’ sexuality knowledge, religious and cultural factors could affect parental attitudes and perceptions towards SE. This understanding could be useful for policymakers and educators to encourage collaboration with parents to strengthen the effectiveness of the program and scale up SE to benefit the young generation."

A quantitative research design was employed to address the central theme: The identification of the gap between the beliefs and perceptions of STEM Educators regarding the role of research in university teaching. T-test was used to test the difference between the actual and ideal beliefs of teachers. Cohen’s d values were computed to determine the effect sizes. The present study revealed that the STEM teachers highly valued the role of research in teaching. They especially considered the development of creative and critical dispositions as the most important goals of integrating research into teaching. However, the teachers reported low actual integration of research into their current teaching, revealing a major gap between their beliefs and the perceived actual integration research into their own teaching practices as evident in the result of the statistical tests. It further showed that institutional background appeared to be critical in the integration of research in teaching. Ultimately, STEM education in the university is emphatic on research content in the delivery of instruction while creating opportunities for learners to participate along the learning process.

The tarannum is a technique to beautify and curve the tone of voice, in a certain tempo and rhythm when reading the Quran. The main aim of Tarannum-SLA is to facilitate the process of learning tarannum. Also, this courseware could create awareness among Muslims on the importance of the Quran. The Tarannum-SLA was developed not only to attract Muslims but also for non-Muslims who are interested to know about Islam, especially in terms of the arts of Quran recitation. Furthermore, in this courseware, we provide three language options, which are Malay, English, and Arabic for the convenience of our diverse prospective users. There are seven styles of tarannum, including Bayyati, Nahwand, Hijaz, Rast, Soba, Jiharkah, and Sika that are included in the Tarannum-SLA. We also introduce Dato 'Ahmad Faizul bin Ghazali who is a winner of the Majlis Tilawah al-Quran Peringkat Kebangsaan 2003 for the recording process. Furthermore, to examine the ability of Tarannum-SLA to tackle the users’ needs, we have conducted the usability analysis based on the Diffusion of Innovation Model by Rogers (1983). The result indicated that most of the constructs are perceived at a high level by respondents. Thus, this evidenced the high usability of Tarannum-SLA in promoting Quranic education. Although the development of this courseware has reached the implementation stage, it still needs some future improvements, for example, to amend the verses and reciters."

Due to its importance for study success, students are required to maintain their academic reading engagement. With engagement, they would be enabled to persevere and be more spirited in their reading efforts. However, not all students perceive academic reading positively, particularly in EFL learning environment where English reading is seen as something daunting. Academic reading engagement is essentially determined by a number of dimensions, one of which is affective dimension. This research aims to portray the affective dimension of the academic reading engagement among student teachers of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in a teacher-training university in Indonesia. Eight EFL student teachers were selected from three classes of an English content course which required a lot of academic reading. These student teachers were interviewed using a semi-structured guide. The results show that many EFL student teachers’ efforts in coping with course-related reading materials were externally driven. They showed low liking for learning, demonstrated little enthusiasm, interest, enjoyment, and confidence in relation to academic reading. Also, they did not always understand the values of academic reading and text relevance for their development as teachers."

However, “several experiments have already established that existing readability measures in English cannot directly be used to compute readability of other languages.” To validate the Waray Text Readability Instrument (WTRI) formula, 15 stories  were rated by 24 randomly selected teachers from two elementary schools in Tacloban City. The WTRI software uses two factors in determining readability, namely: (a) sentence length and (b) frequency of commonly occurring words. The teachers’ task is to read the given text and rate the grade level of each text by considering these three factors: (1) frequency of commonly used words; (2) sentence length; and, (3) total number of words. The data gathered was compared with the WTRI’s ratings of the same texts. Statistical testing was done to determine if there is a significant difference between the teachers’ rating of the texts and the WTRI’s ratings. As a result, there was no significant difference between the software’s grade level ratings and that of the teachers’. It implied that the WTRI’s calculation is valid."

This finding is proved to be effective in enabling students to solve problems. By utilizing the finding as well as employing qualitative and development methods, this research serves a purpose of developing learning method that can improving students’ soft skills attributes based on personality types. This leads to the conclusion that the cognitive process will also have the same influence on personal and interpersonal behaviors. The findings gained from this research demonstrate that soft skills attribute showed by every personality is various and it can be improved through the application of learning models that put forward cognitive process based of personality type classification. According to the gained findings, it is recommended that this learning model can be expanded to cover other subjects in higher education syllabus"

This paper useddescriptive qualitative research methods to describe the phenomena of educational activities, learning, and curriculum implementation related to character education based on local wisdom of the Sasak ethnic group in East Lombok elementary schools. Data were collected by using interview techniques, group observation, and documentation. Data analysis was organised into some categories, describing it into units, synthesizing, arranging into patterns, interpreting and making conclusions. The main problem faced in the implementation of character education in East Lombok Elementary School is the absence of a character education model that is appropriate or methodologically adequate for learning process, it is individually developed continuously. The richness and diversity of Sasakness culture with the values of local wisdom has potential to be integrated holistically into the curriculum both in co-curricular, intra- intra-curricular and extra-curricular aspects, and even has the leverage to become the basis for character education. So that character education in East Lombok elementary schools based on Sasak ethnic local wisdom is very urgent to be implemented."

In the study, it was considered whether preschool teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs and their teaching attitudes change in terms of certain variables. The research was carried out using a correlational survey model. The target population of the study is the preschool teachers working in Küçükçekmece district, İstanbul Province, in the 2017-2018 academic year. The working group consists of 264 preschool teachers working at the schools in said district. The following assessment instruments were used in the research: “Personal Information Form,” “Preschool Teachers’ Self-efficacy Beliefs Scale,” to identify preschool teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs and ‘Preschool Teachers’ Teaching Attitudes Scale’ to determine the teachers’ attitudes. The obtained data were analyzed using Pearson multiplication moment correlation analysis, and Regression analysis was performed to determine the level of self-efficacy beliefs of preschool teachers affecting teaching attitudes. Preschool teachers were found to have full self-efficacy beliefs in the teaching-learning process, communication skills, planning, and regulation of learning environments and classroom management, and firm self-efficacy beliefs in family participation. Teachers’ attitudes of preschool teachers were found to be democratic at the highest level, followed by autocratic and laissez-faire at the lowest level. As a result of the regression analysis made to determine the level of the effect of self-efficacy beliefs of preschool teachers on their teaching attitudes, the learning and teaching process positively predicts democratic teaching attitudes and negatively predicts laissez-faire attitudes."

An explanatory-correlational research design was used to determine the extent of relationship between three categories of employability skills (using The Conference Board of Canada’s Employability Skills 2000+) and five elements of Contextual Performance adopted from Borman and Motowidlo’s Taxonomy. There were a total of 220 respondents representing the groups of employers and employees from 25 government institutions in the south-central part of Mindanao region, Philippines. Inferential analysis shows that fundamental skills had moderate relationship with employees’ contextual performance; however, being more competent in thinking and problem solving skills provides employees with more benefits in performing contextual behavior.  Findings further revealed that although personal management skills had moderate relationship with employees’ contextual behavior, the competence in personal adaptability and learning continuously are contributory across all elements of contextual performance. Finally, the result of the study yielded that teamwork skills, particularly the skill on working with others, were also moderately correlated with employees’ contextual performance. This implies that graduates’ competence in employability skills could give them due advantage in their respective work settings.  Thus, proper attention on developing competence on employability skills by employers, employees, higher academic institutions, labor agencies, and policy makers may help address the problems on job performance."

Qualitative data were gathered from the informants’ interview during the implementation of the lesson study. Data were processed through document trail among the informants to ascertain the veracity of the transcribed responses, reflections, and observations. Thematic analysis revealed five themes on the experiences of the teachers in implementing the Lesson Study: developing a culture of oneness, crafting teachers’ competence through synergism, boosting teachers’ morale and confidence, refining the quality of the research lesson, and scheming avenues for critical thinking. It is, therefore, suggested that lesson study be implemented by all teachers across all subject-areas in the division and introduced among pre-service teachers to further discover its efficacy towards teachers’ development and students’ outcomes. Furthermore, it is strongly suggested that knowledgeable others be involved in the implementation of the lesson study as their presence were found significant in ensuring its success as most of the teachers are not specialized in the field that they are teaching."

It also concurrently examines the integration of Ignatian values and social issues in learning the said concept. This study aimed to establish a culture of planning, collaboration, and reflection in developing the understanding and relevance of mathematical concepts in grade school through lesson study. The study showed how the process of lesson study was done given the following phases: planning phase, implementation phase, and post-lesson reflection and discussion phase. Emphasis on the planning phase was given on the details of the lesson design which aimed to integrate Ignatian values in the discussion while developing algebraic thinking from quasi-variable thinking delivered in the implementation phase. Findings highlighted on three statements: i) Collaborative lesson planning nurtures a deeper sense of scholarship and collegiality; ii) Building algebraic thinking from quasi-variable (arithmetic) thinking is a viable strategy for understanding the concept of algebraic equation; and iii) Looking into the “big picture” and responding to relevant social issues could strengthen meaning - integration of Ignatian values. Strong collaboration and communication among teachers in creating detailed lesson design enabled more meaningful learning among pupils. Research revealed the significant role of lesson study in creating meaningful strategies and activities which provided efficient structure in developing a chosen lesson topic.

Although this is contrary to moral life, there are still many people who pursue it. Internal and external factors exist in human life related to the existence of materialism. Self satisfaction and individual life goals are internal factors that exist within the individual. Materialistic people will feel satisfied through acquisition of possessions, financial success, attaining status and having the right image. This perception is negatively correlated with well-being, even so they believe that their life goals will be achieved through materialism. Environmental, social and social media influences that are external factors in an individual can provide a tendency to influence one's behavior. The recognition of social status based on wealth will have an impact on materialism that will be difficult to escape from his life. The hedonist lifestyle and corruption are the effects of this growing materialism.

In India, considerable progress has been reported to be made in the field of basic universal education, gender equality in education, economic growth and other human development related aspects. Even though the government has implemented a wide array of programmes, policies, and various schemes to combat these challenges, further intensification of efforts and redesigning of outreach strategies are needed to give momentum to the progress toward achievement of the MDG-2 (Achieve Universal Primary Education) and MDG-3 (Promote Gender Equality).To universalize elementary education, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) is one of the major schemes introduced by the government in 2002. Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS) and Alternative and Innovative Education are the components of SSA. Universal enrolment is one of the specific objectives of SSA. The strategy of implementation of Mid-Day Meal Scheme has also played a role in enhancing the enrolment and retention of the students. To focus on girls’ education, several schemes have been incorporated within SSA. National Programmes for Education of Girls at Elementary Level (NPEGEL) and Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya Scheme (KGBVS) focus on primary education for girls. In order to achieve this, there is need to ensure sufficient number of schools along with adequately trained teachers for quality instruction and effective functioning of primary education programmes. This is more true in the context of RTE- 2009. Achieving universal schooling requires cent percent enrolment and it also means ensuring that all children continue to attend classes till completion of eight years of schooling (6-14 years) in the near future. Education benefits not only at the individual level but also for the development of country as a whole.  Further gender inequality in education has a direct impact on economic growth through lower levels of quality of human capital. In the light of these emergent issues in school education there is need to develop a sense of higher levels of commitment and sincerity among the prospective teachers. The teacher education programmes need to be reoriented to look into the issues related to enrolment and retention of children along with ensuring quality inputs in teaching -learning process. Hence an effort has been made to address to these issues in school education for the effective designing of on-going teacher education programmes to enable the prospective teachers as well as those in schools for effective implementation of different interventionistic programmes.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.11591/ijere.v3i2.5652"

Hence, one of the ways to address the unemployment issue among young graduates in Malaysia is to explore how entrepreneurial intention could be embraced into the broader context of the country's education system. Empirical research found that prior studies on entrepreneurship education in Malaysia tends to focus on reviewing educational policies, issue and challenges. The concept of the entrepreneurial intention determinants beyond entrepreneurial education remains ambiguous. Hence, this study advances the discussion in entrepreneurship education by reviewing determinants for entrepreneurial intention from holistic perspective by integrating Model of Personality Traits and the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Five determinants for entrepreneurial intention are identified from literature review, which are entrepreneurship attitude, subjective norm, behavior control, entrepreneurship education and personality traits. The study is quantitative based, 360 questionnaires were distributed to the undergraduates from three faculties of a public university in Malaysia, with 199 responded. Data was analyzed via Pearson correlation and ANOVA analysis. Finding from the study suggested all the five entrepreneurial determinants are significantly correlated with entrepreneurial intention, and there is no significant difference on entrepreneurial intention based on faculty. However, one of the remarkable finding is Entrepreneurship Education is viewed as determinant with the lowest correlation coefficient with entrepreneurial intention. The implication of this finding is perhaps the content of entrepreneurial education shall emphasize on cultivating students’ entrepreneurial attitude, behavioral and personality rather than the theoretical part of entrepreneurial and entrepreneurship."

Therefore, this study attempts to identify the factors affecting RP and develop an appropriate model to determine the RP of an academic staff in Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM). In this study, 5 research related indicators were used in the determination of RP. Since the population size of UiTM is large, the primary data was collected by using questionnaire survey and stratified random sampling. The variables that were found to be significant in determining RP of an academic staff were age cohort, highest qualification, cluster and track emphasis. Satisfaction towards annual KPI, UiTM current policy and monthly income were also found to influence the RP of an academic staff. In addition, perceiving the role of principal investigator as a chore and burden and supervising and graduating a PhD student perception as burden and pleasure were also found to be affecting RP. Using these variables, Logistic Regression Model was used to determine the RP of an academic staff in UiTM. In conclusion, personal, environmental and behavioural factors were found to have influence on the RP among academic staff of UiTM. Therefore, generally it is possible to maximize the RP of academic staff by identifying the factors influencing RP followed by strategic management and proper monitoring system."

Videos analyses elicited that there is a variety of ways to facilitate an interactive learning environment in the classroom. The results revealed that the quality of teacher facilitation (52%) and students’ engagement (60%) were moderately high. However, teachers’ level of questioning was found low and could directly affect students’ participation in learning. Field notes also revealed that there was little guidance in the problem-solving process and the classroom discourse.

Moreover, economic and cultural capital becomes significant resources that are valuable in explaining the college readiness of Filipino Senior High School (SHS) graduates. Those who come from families with higher economic and cultural capital tend to have higher college readiness. Remarkably, the low economic and cultural capital of the students possibly explains their lack of college readiness. As they have less economic and cultural capital, they tend to have fewer competencies to capacitate them in hurdling tertiary education.

In this development, the trichotomous and the 2X2 models received myriad attention from the educational specialist. However, there is a debate about which is better between the two models. This study aimed to intercede this debate and argue that the study's duration should be accounted for in the validation. Approach goals should dominate new students' achievement goals, and old students' achievement goals will show the balance of approach and avoidance goals. For these reasons, this study gathers the data from 350 new students and 203 old students. Confirmatory factor analysis reveals that the trichotomous is the best model for new student segments. While for the old student segment, the 2X2 model shows its efficacy. Therefore, for the new students' segment, achievement goals consist of mastery-approach, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance goals. For the old students, besides those three-goal orientations, mastery-avoidance goals are also included. As expected, the independent sample t-test shows that new students have higher mastery-approach and performance-approach goals than old students have. Self-efficacy is more influential in the new than old student segments, as shown by simple linear regression. This study is still stuck to a single cross-sectional design. Further research can utilize longitudinal research with segmental-based analysis and pay attention to gender, major, social class, or other potential moderation variables."

Adolescents of the 21st century are complex in nature, and school stakeholders are having much difficulty to handle the problem of indiscipline in secondary schools. This paper aims at providing a conceptual model framework for learner discipline management. This model is the result of an empirical investigation conducted in four secondary schools. Focus group discussion and individual interviews were carried out with 80 participants, including 24 teachers, 24 learners, 24 parents, four school principals, and four school superintendents. The non-participant observation was also conducted in the four schools. Based on the conceptual, theoretical and empirical literature on positive, proactive, preventive and restorative discipline, the researcher proposed the model that considers all the research- and evidence-based strategies that are combined with the current effective measures prescribed by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of Mauritius. The model is framed within the context of the Nine Year Continuous Basic Education reform that requires a shift in the conception of discipline from the punitive or reactive approach to the positive approach. This paper formulates a conceptual model framework to implement in an attempt to prevent, reverse and restore discipline among learners in secondary schools."

However, these abilities in Indonsia are still relatively low, especially student’s scientific literacy skills. One solution to the problem of low scientific literacy skills in Indonesia is the application of STEM education. However, as technology advances pursued in STEM education, religious and cultural sciences increasingly separate themselves from science. Cultural science is rarely implemented in learning so that many students do not know their own culture. The contra between science and religion also makes students’s perception of religion and science are two independent knowledge and cannot be united. Through literature studies that have been carried out from various journal article search sites, this article discusses how important religious and cultural sciences are to be implemented into STEM education. The relationship between religion and science, culture and science, culture and religion and the urgency of religion and culture in STEM education are also discussed in this article. The results of this study propose solutions so that science education can be implemented with RE-STEM learning to overcome the gap between religion, culture and science. So, that students will have a more balanced knowledge in religion, ethnoscience and science from RE-STEM integration."

The emerging skill gap requires a shift in the type of expertise required of young professionals that will be needed to successfully lead organizations in the new economy. Researchers have identified various ‘shapes’ for the engineering professionals to make them relevant to the 21st century challenge, especially in the industry where their expertise is much needed. T-shaped professionals have skills that make them to be more preferred among others. The purpose of this paper is to present the need to upgrade engineering education curriculum to produce more T-shaped graduate engineers required in the changing industrial world. The potential benefits of T-shaped professionals to organizational performance are quite significant; hence, the demand for T-shaped professionals in knowledge-intensive, service-oriented economies is increasing. Unfortunately, the challenges associated with creating more T-shaped professionals are also significant. National regulatory bodies for engineering education in Nigeria are beginning to move towards integrated curriculum to break down discipline silos and produce T-shaped graduate engineers for the fast-changing industrial world.

We purposively selected 82 participants to respond to our scales of mattering types and SWB. Among our inclusion criteria was to have limited living partner (0-3) in order to make sure that their mattering was predominantly built from the social media feedback. The result of the multiple regression analysis suggested that despite their interpersonal mattering had a weaker contribution to their SWB, it was still a significant predictor of SWB when controlling for societal mattering.

This paper is going to consider some of the critical thinkers’ theories in order to clarify teacher and student interactions in education. The research is a type of fundamental and qualitative study which frames teacher and student interactions by means of a descriptive – analytical method. Accordingly, we introduce critical teacher as a teacher who includes specific characteristics like emancipation, critical nature and openness. Therefore mentioned teacher attends the role of culture in human life and he resists reproduced by the regime. He is someone who provides the way for public hearing; in addition, he teaches his students how to resist domination. On the other side, a student in this school will not be dominated by the regime by means of its essential tools as probe and questioning. A student has been taught to hear everyone regardless of race, religion and social class. Finally, this paper proposes applying these ideas for educational systems informal and operational ways."

The educational reform prompts prospective teachers to connect the concepts taught to instill a more profound understanding. As such, the researcher explored the mathematical connections made by prospective secondary mathematics teachers while completing investigative tasks. The study employed a concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design. Data were gathered from the thirty-nine prospective secondary mathematics teachers enrolled in the state universities' flagship campuses in Northeastern Philippines. Data were gathered using mathematical connections evaluation, think-aloud strategy, and interview. Frequency counts, percentages, mean percent scores, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, and analysis of the interviews' transcriptions were employed in the study. Results show that the prospective teachers performed best in making instruction-oriented connections but have difficulty in making implications connection. Also, the prospective teachers' ability to successfully make the mathematical connection is directly linked to their knowledge of the concept, the algorithm, and the part-whole relationship. As such, reform efforts should be made to enhance mathematical connections, emphasizing statistical thinking, and reasoning. Moreover, higher education institutions should incorporate connecting as one of the intended learning outcomes for prospective mathematics teachers."

Hence, this study ascertained the interrelation between the public school head’s leadership practices and teachers’ performance. As correlation research, simple random sampling was used to calculate the sample size for teachers, while total enumeration was used for school heads. A structured questionnaire was developed to gather the necessary information that reinforced the theme of this analysis. Weighted mean was used to ascertain the level of leadership practices of school heads and the level of teacher performance. T-test, F-test, post-hoc test, and Pearson r were employed to establish the degree of association between and among variables. This study concluded that the variation in leadership practices experienced by school heads and teachers is absolutely vital, confirming that their reactions are fundamentally better. Teachers' performance is consistent irrespective of age, educational achievement, or significant contributions. In terms of teaching status and number of years of experience, head teachers have improved teaching efficiency than teachers and master teachers. Teachers with shorter relevant experience showed poorer educational quality relative to those who spent more time in the school system. School heads who have obtained their doctorate degrees get a greater level of leadership practices than the holders of master's degrees. The very productive performance of teachers stays the same, regardless of whether the school heads exhibit a very high degree of authentic leadership."

However, little research has been done to explore the feelings of students towards RJW and how such has an effect on their mathematics learning. This study aimed to describe the feelings of the students about RJW. Being a qualitative type of research study, data were acquired through focus group discussion and were analyzed using axial coding. Results revealed that RJW (i) provided opportunities for the students to construct meaning and express personal views and ideas; (ii) built a connection between the teacher and the students; (iii) through the use of prompts, allowed the students to relate mathematics to real-life facts improving their understanding of the subject; (iv) helped the students build association of ideas using their prior knowledge and experiences; and (v) enabled the students to develop self-awareness. The findings suggest that when students are engaged in reflective writing experiences which explicitly promote meaning-making or self-questioning, teachers create an opportunity for them to see how the process of writing can enrich their mathematical learning."

The applications like Google meet or Google zoom are rarely used, although they give the chance to the students and the teacher to interact directly. This has caused fewer feedbacks given by the teacher, making the students bored in attending the class. If this practice is allowed to continue it will have a negative effect on learning. This study aimed at analyzing the effect of blended learning with combined synchronized and unsynchronized settings on self-efficacy and achievement of the students in learning basic design. The population was 145 students of SMKs (vocational schools) who learned basic design. The schools that were used as sample were selected through multistage random sampling which selected 4 schools with 115 students. The data for self-efficacy were collected with a questionnaire and those for learning achievement with a multiple-choice test. The data that were gathered were subjected to descriptive statistical test and inferential statistical test of MANOVA. The MANOVA test result showed that simultaneously and partially there was a positive effect of blended learning with combined synchronized and unsynchronized settings on self-efficacy and learning achievement as shown by sig. value of MANOVA test at p <0.05. Therefore, blended learning with combined synchronized and unsynchronized settings has a positive effect on the students’ self-efficacy and learning achievement in basic design, thus making the learning more joyful and more conducive."

IPE has been adopted at Udayana University by involving seven health courses at Udayana University, Bali, Indonesia. These students were assigned to 49 groups which composed the seven health course students. They learned working in collaboration from cases identified in the community. The activities spanned for five semesters. At the beginning of their activities the students received interprofessional collaboration competencies attainment survey (ICCAS). The survey has been validated in the population and has two collaborative competencies, namely communication and collaboration. This was a report of ICCAS employment in Semester III dan IV of the first cohort of IPE Program at Udayana University. 138 students completed the survey in both semesters. A paired-sample t-test was conducted to compare the mean score differences of collaboration and communication in the first and second semesters of attending IPE learning. Whilst, there was no significant differences on the mean score for communication, there was a significant difference in the mean score for pre and post collaboration (94.7±9.7) and (91.0±10.8); t(130)=3.379, p=0.001. These results suggest that the collaboration competencies amongst the seven health courses students reduced after one semester attending IPE activities.

Learning to recognize animals is one of the methods to stimulate the children's brain growth to imagine. Nevertheless, kids tend to spend all their time by playing and could not focus to recognize the animals due to the way of learning which is usually not interactive and not interesting. Therefore, a game application was designed and developed to be used as a way to help children in recognizing the animals. This program was developed as a mobile game application with the animation and attractive display to increase the kids' interest to learn the animals. Beside that, Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm has been successfully implemented on the game to randomize the images which can be found on puzzles, randomize the answers in image guessing puzzles, randomize animals to choose which can be sold, randomize the foods which will be given to the pets, and randomize the initial position to create patterns on rescue rare animal puzzles. After the implementation and testing on the game application, it proves that it could increase the kids’ interest in learning new animals to 4.18 in ARCS interest measuring index compare with textbook method which only 2.74."

Conventional teaching methods often cause lower learning gain, fear and bad perceptions among students. The old initiative may also be the cause of students’ demotivation, lower interest in learning a subject or even dropouts. This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of an inverted classroom by using the problem-based method in Biology subject among science foundation students. Students were divided into two groups; experimental (EG) and control (CG) group. A topic in Biology had been selected, and an assessment paper was given to both groups before and after the intervention session. The EG would experience self-learning through given materials and asked to conduct a problem-based learning study case. Meanwhile, the CG would obey the conventional teaching method before given a similar study case. The result reported significant improvement in assessment marks for EG group compared to the CG group. The students’ comparison between the pre- and post-test implies that they have shown positive improvement in understanding the content of the subject tested. This finding will serve as a primary platform to improvise and enhance teaching and learning methodology in biology subject for foundation level."

In Mexico, teachers and students found it necessary to adopt the online modality at all levels. As a result, both students and teachers face new demands and a re-conceptualization of their everyday academic lives. This study explored the engineering students' perception of the favorable effect level that the class context has on their learning. There were 551 participants took a cognitive algebra study. The experimental task involved reading 12 scenarios that described hypothetical online or face-to-face learning situations; then, each participant judged the degree to which these types of situations favor their learning, using an 11-point scale. The results indicated three cognitive styles when judging the degree to which each class context favors the learning. These styles share a similar cognitive mechanism in terms of information integration; however, the selection process and valuation of the factors differed across the groups. The students' perception on the class context influences their involvement and motivation level for courses on which they are enrolled. The present study's findings suggest that the cognitive algebra approach helps diagnose students' cognitive and emotional approach styles for different class contexts and provides information about the nature of their cognitive processes in terms of how students' judgments and attitudes towards classes are generated."

While research has revealed that proficiency pairings affect students’ writing achievement, little is known about the types of EFL students’ verbal episodes in proficiency pairings. This study aims to describe EFL students’ verbal episodes in proficiency pairings. A case study design was used in this study. It involved 40 EFL students of the English department in an Indonesian university who were divided into two groups based on the types of proficiency pairings: heterogeneous (20 students) and homogenous (20 students). Therefore, this study also intends to identify which of the two types of proficiency pairings produces more verbal episodes than the other. The results of the study show that Indonesian EFL students used three major types of verbal episodes: language-related episodes (LREs), text-related episodes (TREs), and scaffolding episodes (SEs). The study also revealed that proficiency levels determined the categories of LREs and SEs most frequently produced by heterogeneous and homogeneous pairs, while both heterogeneous and homogeneous pairs were likely to produce almost the same frequencies of categories of TREs more particularly in terms of organization and content."

Even though assessment processes for accreditation are well documented but existence of an evaluation process is assumed. This work provides performance metrics such as attainment, student achievement, and x-th percentile for the evaluation of assessment data at course and program level. Then, a sample course data and uniformly distributed synthetic data are used to analyze the results from designed metrics. The primary findings of this work are twofold: (i) analysis with sample course assessment data reveals that qualitative mapping between marks obtained in assessments to the defined outcomes is essential for meaningful results, (ii) analysis with synthetic data shows that higher values of one metric does not imply higher values of the other metrics and they depend upon the obtained marks distribution. In particular, for uniformly distributed marks, achievement < attainment for meanOfUniformDistr. < averageMarks < passingT hreshold(α).

However, the transition from the quarantined period to the new normal lifestyle amidst the pandemic in Malaysia might have altered the way mattering predicts happiness. Some studies have reported that students tend to feel less socially supported during online studies, and not every one of them showed high optimism or the belief that a better situation will come soon. We hypothesized that in the new normal, the association between mattering and happiness is fully mediated by perceived social support and optimism. In order to test the hypothesis, 400 university students between 18 to 30 years of age were recruited to respond to the Satisfaction with Life Scale, Revised life orientation test, mattering to others questionnaire, and multidimensional scale of perceived social support. Analyses with Bootstrap method with 5,000 sampling and 95% confidence interval using PROCESS Macro Model 4 yielded results, which suggested that mattering is still a robust predictor of happiness and that both perceived social support and optimism only partially mediated the association.

The paper also elaborates on the relevant training workshops, courses, modules, and curricula that can be implemented to help improve their practical skills. The discussion also highlights the importance of incentives, such as attractive salaries, bonuses, acknowledgments, and awards, from employers that can not only motivate trainees but also advance their professional growth and development. Certainty, strong development knowledge, practical skills, and experiences can help such trainees to be become highly competent, which can significantly contribute to nation-building efforts in Malaysia."

This study aimed to describe students' attitudes towards STEM and 21st-century skills according to gender and education level. This research was descriptive quantitative by explaining and comparing the results of the questionnaires given to students. Student attitudes were described based on domain of STEM, 21st-century skills, gender, and student grade level. The respondent of this study was 130 elementary students who were obtained randomly from one of the elementary schools in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The results showed that based on the science domain, the mean score of the students was 3.23 (moderate) while mathematics domain obtained was 3.21 (moderate); technology/engineering domain obtained was 3.68 (moderate) and 21st-century skill domain obtained was 3.65 (moderate). According to gender, there was a significant difference between the attitudes of male and female students towards STEM and 21st-century skills. However, there was no significant difference based on the grade of students. Based on these findings, it is suggested that teachers or policymakers should have comprehended the student attitudes before implemented the STEM-based learning and 21st-century skills. These findings can be used to create STEM and 21st-century learning."

Data collected using the democratic attitude scale were analyzed using t-test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, and Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Results showed that attitude scores did not change according to gender, level of parents’ education or the year students were in. Scale scores were negatively correlated with the amount of parents’ income. There was no correlation between the students’ GPAs and the scale scores. Music teaching requires a democratic environment intrinsically; therefore, the democratic perceptions and attitudes of the music teacher candidates who will carry out the music lessons in which they should maintain the democratic environment must be determined.

Various teen problems haunt when they grow up to become adults. The same teenagers successfully face the challenges of their development so that they are free from a variety of risky behaviors. However, some of them also smoke, consume alcohol, have free sex, commit violence, and use drugs. This research is a qualitative study with a phenomenological approach in which researchers explore and try some risky behaviors in health and factors that influence and how adolescents in vocational high schools end up committing some risky behavior. The results of the study show that teens who do not have risky behavior and who do have some risk behaviors have different understandings related to the impact of these behaviors. People around teenagers influence how teenagers will behave. These influential people can cause teenagers to take risky behavior, such as family problems, get bad examples from parents, family members, peers, and idols. Factors that influence adolescents to end up committing risky behavior are the understanding of the negative effects of risk behavior. The various causes of influential people include parents, peers, religious leaders, idols, perceived benefits, self-control, and intention. The internal and external factors of adolescents determine whether the teenager will do or not risky behavior. Strong collaboration between internal and external factors shapes behavior which is not risky in adolescents, and vice versa."

These virtual worlds are considered an additional proposal within the e-learning model. Online platforms have not been enough resources to be successful in the teaching and learning processes, therefore, it is necessary to search more options that contribute to their improvement. Virtual worlds, through inverse and visual experiences for the student, offer new panoramas that allow living situations and solving problems in different areas, such as mathematics. This article analyzes the opinion of higher- level students regarding the use of virtual worlds in their distance classes. Likewise, the virtual worlds provide help in improving teacher-student and student-student relationships. Some cases of educational institutions that integrated the use of virtual worlds into their classes are shown. A Likert-type scale questionnaire has been applied to a sample of 64 higher-level students; Its reliability was validated by means of Cronbach's alpha coefficients and Pearson's. It was found that students consider that the use of virtual worlds would improve class work and relationships between their peers and their teachers. It is remarkably undoubted that virtual worlds within education path are considered an excellent tool for e-learning, however, although the interest on the part of students is high, it is necessary to carry out more researching and developing procedures on the virtual worlds as an alternative to support learning."

Dynamic assessment is an alternative approach to constructing the form of scaffolding that students need to solve mathematical word problems. This study aims to analyze the students' difficulties in solving word problems and the required form of scaffolding through dynamic assessment. The subjects of this study consisted of 177 students spread across ten public junior high schools in Jeneponto Regency, South Sulawesi Province. There is a four-word problem that is tested and analyzed using dynamic assessment. Student solutions are grouped based on the type and form of scaffolding needed, namely; level 5 (no solution), level 4 (without analysis/unrepresentative), level 3 (computational error), level 2 (incomplete procedure), level 1 (lack of thoroughness in the final stage). The form of scaffolding is constructed to help students solve mathematical word problems step by step at each level.

The aim of this study is to investigate the activities which are written by prospective primary school teachers in the context of Realistic Mathematics Education. This research is a case study of which data were collected by qualitative methods. The participants of the research included 81 prospective primary teachers who are junior students attended primary teacher department. It was asked them to write an activity suitable for primary mathematics curriculum by considering Realistic Mathematics Education principles. They were given one month to write the activities. The activities written by prospective teachers analyzed by descriptive methods in terms of learning domains, types of context and principles of Realistic Mathematics Education. Totally 36 activities were written by prospective teachers. Based on the analysis, it was observed that not all the contexts were exactly real life contexts. It was determined that prospective teacher could not distinguish routine word problems from real life problems. It can be said that theoretical knowledge of Realistic Mathematics Education is inadequate for writing activities and prospective primary teachers need to practice on writing activities regarding the mentioned theory."

The test is a source and as a material for mapping the competencies that a teacher has regarding professional and pedagogical competence in an area. The low competence of the pedagogical field shows that teachers are not professional. Therefore the teacher will find it difficult to be able to provide a good pursuit of students. One way to improve the competence of teachers in pedagogic fields is by increasing teacher understanding and knowledge of local wisdom in learning. The essence of local and national cultural values in the education curriculum is now a bustling thing to be talked about by the people of Indonesia. Social ethnoconstructivism is able to be a solution amid the current developments and cultural shifts. This study wants to see how high the impact of ethnoconstuctivistic knowledge on teacher pedagogical competencies. In addition, age and gender are also separate discussions to see their influence on pedagogical competence. This research uses descriptive qualitative research. Samples in this study were elementary school teachers in three districts/cities in Jambi Province. The results show that teachers' ethnoconstructivism knowledge has an influence on the teacher's 
 pedagogical competence. The age of a teacher also has an impact on 
 pedagogical competence, but gender does not affect the teacher's

However, research productivity remains to be low among Philippine HEIs as compared to its neighboring countries. This descriptive study evaluates the research productivity of a state university in Central Luzon, Philippines, for the past five years (2016-2020) as basis for policy formulation. The study used document analysis to ascertain the research productivity in terms of (1) number of papers published in refereed international journals such as Scopus and CHED (Commission on Higher Education) accredited journals; (2) number of faculty researchers with publication to these journals; and (3) total number of citations. The data were obtained primarily from online publications found in the Google Scholar and Scopus databases. Results revealed that the state university's research productivity is relatively high in terms of published papers in refereed international journals for the past five years. However, the published papers in Scopus-indexed journals and CHED accredited journals are relatively low. An average number of faculty researchers publish their works in reputable journals, but very few faculty publish in the journals recommended by the CHED. Likewise, the university had a remarkable research citation record for the past five years.  The findings of this research have important implications for policy to improve research productivity and enhance the research culture in HEIs. Such policies include the need to have strong support to faculty researchers, forge research collaborations, source external research funding, and establish a sound incentive mechanism."

Anti-corruption education in Islamic education has so far used a dogmatic approach, not using an approach that has a transformative impact, especially neuroscience. In this case, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan, with lecturers who have special competence as anti-corruption trainers, has carried out anti-corruption education in various scientific fields, including Islamic education. This phenomenological type of qualitative research involved 52 students and six lecturers in the master study program of Islamic education. The results showed that anti-corruption education was carried out through insertion into all relevant subjects, especially the neuroscience of Islamic education. The lecturer investigates students' corrupt behavior in anticipation of future corruption crimes. The investigation results show that the most corrupt behavior of students is plagiarism, taking names in group assignments, and leaving absences with friends. The insertion of anti-corruption education with a neuroscience approach is applied in building integrity awareness that corrupt behavior is contrary to how the brain works and even has the potential to destroy reason."

This is because “if any aspect of a test is unfamiliar to candidates, they are likely to perform less well than they would do otherwise on subsequently taking a parallel version, for example.” Using the education students of Leyte Normal University, Southern Leyte State University-Tomas Oppus Campus, and Visayas State University, this study determined the students’ preference on the arrangements/format of options in a multiple-choice test through a survey questionnaire. Moreover, it tried to find out the reasons behind the preferences. Mean, frequency and Chi-square tests were used in the analysis of data. Results revealed that the cascading arrangement is the most preferred arrangement of options and the one-line horizontal arrangement is the least preferred arrangement of options in a multiple-choice test. The reasons identified were organized and easy to read, less confusing and easier to distinguish and vertically arranged thus require less eye movement. Moreover, the reasons for the lower case preference were it is usual and commonly used in a multiple-choice test, clear and gives less eye and mental pressure and easier to read and write.And lastly, the relationship between the students’ preference of the arrangement of options in a multiplechoice test and the letter case options were tested using the Chi-square test. Hence, it is argued that in constructing a multiple-choice test, one has to consider using the cascading arrangement."

A mixed-methods approach was used, with an online survey questionnaire administered to 600 students and focus group discussions were conducted with 15 students from these institutions. It was found that 68.4% of respondents used WhatsApp compared to only 23.6% of them who used the e-learning platform, Moodle. There were no associations between the use or frequency of using WhatsApp or Facebook and the types of HEI to which the students belonged. Students preferred WhatsApp due to its facility for knowledge sharing and construction, its interactivity, its usability, respect for privacy and instant communication. From the findings, it is recommended that HEIs bring a shift in their approaches to teaching and learning from cognitivism to socio-constructivism, connectivism and heutagogy."

In-depth interviews were conducted with the staffs of FRHAM to inquire about their effort in delivering their services. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded and emergent themes were identified. FRHAM had played a part as educator, service provider, advocate and actively involved in improving the quality of life among the refugee community. The organization had developed modules for CSE and conducted programs for dissemination of knowledge. They also collaborated with local governmental agencies and other NGOs to promote awareness and utilization of services among the communities. Nevertheless, promoting CSE had experienced many challenges in Malaysia. The perceptions of Malaysian viewing sexuality education as taboos, cultural factors, the reluctance of educators in delivering, and the low visibility of FRHAM are the barriers encountered by FRHAM in promoting CSE. FRHAM recommended including parents, teachers and other stakeholders in the promotion of CSE and acknowledging CSE as an official subject to be implemented in schools.  The information from this study may encourage more partnerships between the stakeholders, policy makers and NGOs for providing high quality CSE and sexual reproductive health services."

The validation of content validity is using the content validity index (CVI) and Modified Kappa statistics. All the items above the cut-off point of 0.8 retained as a final instrument. Therefore, from the 58 items, four items deleted as it's not reached the level of agreement between all the experts. The final instruments for further validation consisted of 54 items which fell under eight dimensions namely (1) creative behaviour; (2) ideal influence; (3) effective communication; (4) technical skills; (5) empowerment and mentoring; (6) entrepreneurship; (7) opening behaviour and; (8) closing behaviour were identified. As a result, the final instrument may be used for further validation."

They begin to manipulate ICT materials as soon as they grow old enough to manipulate things. There is need therefore to provide ICT-learning experiences that can aid their holistic development. To do this, early childhood professionals must be positive about the roles of ICT in children’s development. This study therefore investigated the perception of Early Childhood Education (ECE) lecturers and students on the importance of ICT in preparing ECE teachers for the new generation children. The study adopted the descriptive survey research design. 10 lecturers and 300 students of ECE were purposively selected as sample. One validated questionnaire titled “Questionnaire on Information and Communication Technology” (0.83) was used. Data collected was analysed using percentage, mean and standard deviation. Findings revealed that, using ICT in preparation of ECE teachers can help them to facilitate children’s cognitive, physical and social-emotional development, and as well sustain children’s interest in learning.Recommendations include training of all Nigerian ECE lecturers in the use of ICT for teaching and learning and equipment of departments of ECE in Nigerian Colleges of Education and Universities with adequate and relevant ICT materials.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.11591/ijere.v3i2.5405"

Researchers have consistently pointed to the educational leadership perspectives on giftedness, and inequitable identification of policies and practices in gifted education. Research suggests there is a widening gap in the level of comprehensive knowledge in gifted education that is critical for school improvement. This paper examined school principals’ (n=29) perceptions regarding giftedness among Bahraini students. The study focuses on exploring the characteristics school principals attribute to giftedness in their schools, the methods employed by schools to identify gifted students from the school principals' perspectives, and the educational provisions school principals used to support gifted students in their school. The study also searches for any significant differences among school principals in their views on these three dimensions. The study employed quantitative methodology and the analysis of the research questionnaire included descriptive and interpretive analysis (ANOVA and T-test). The findings indicate that the school principals looked at giftedness mainly from an academic and school perspective. The results indicate some dissonance between what the principals’ perceptions on giftedness are and the educational support that they provided to the gifted students in their schools."

PWDS have specific speech and language impairments which affect all aspects of development. Some children develop difficult behaviors which cause family stress and affect social and educational inclusion. These deficits are worsened by a higher incidence of certain medical problems which were extensive from birth to old age. Being intellectually challenged, PWDS face many challenges and barriers to care for themselves, to lead rich and varied lives as well as to get involved in all aspects of community life. Besides helping them to assume responsibility for their own wellbeing, it is upon dedications from all parties to assist them to live a longer life expectancy with dignity and wellness intact. This paper aims to understand the scope of wellness for PWDS and the hindering factors as well as identifying contributions towards wellness of PWSD, its flaws and suggestions for improvement. The analysis and discussion is grounded in the context of Malaysia against the backdrop of PWDS across nations. This paper concludes that People with Disabilities (PWD) in Malaysia are protected by different laws and Acts. Many services are provided by government and NGO but these provisions do not benefit PWDS as much as their disabled peers who are not intellectually challenged. Job opportunities and total wellness especially after finishing the basic schooling seems quite bleak for PWSD due to their obvious cognitive delays and adaptive behaviors.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.11591/ijere.v3i3.6453"

Moreover, the study sought to propose a theory which could explain the students’ career choice from a social environmental perspective. Primary data for this study were collected from 120 students selected from fourteen academic departments of the Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU) in Bangladesh based on snow-ball sampling. The study revealed that several factors involving students’ family preferences, teachers’ advice, job prestige, job security, remunerations, scope of promotion, scope of pension, scope of professional development, personal interests, academic majors, educational attainments and career development trainings have significant association with the students’ career decision-making. However, gender and social class did not have significant effects on the students’ career choice. The study proposed a career choice theory which indicates that the students’ career choice and career preferences are not determined by their personal interests alone; rather they are determined by the interplay of several social, cultural and economic forces. The study indicated that the majority of the respondents undertake self-study to pursue their preferred jobs. While career development trainings play an important role in developing the competencies of the students for jobs, a majority of the respondents do not have such trainings. As such, the study suggested that the students of the NSTU should undertake career development courses as a strategy for job preparedness. Finally, the study suggested that the NSTU should set up a career guidance and counseling cell to link their students with the current labor market."

As a result, Type I error rates of both indices were found to be below the acceptable nominal alpha levels.  The power study showed that average test difficulty was very effective for power (true detection) rates of indices. Clear patterns were observed for the increase of test difficulty in favor of both ω and GBT power rate. Contrary to expectations; average test discrimination was not as effective as average test difficulty. The results of the interaction effects of item discrimination and difficulty showed that for the cases whose b parameters were lower than 0 with weak discrimination, indices had weak power for both ω and GBT. In addition, for the cases whose b parameter levels were below zero with high discrimination indices, the power performance of both answer-copying indices were very weak. Results for test length showed that with the increase of test length the power rate of both ω and GBT tended to increase.

Both focus group interviews and an online survey were conducted to investigate the experiences of using online MCQ exercise with multiple attempts in relation to the development of self-directed learning (SDL). The findings of the study showed that the criticisms may be unfounded. Data leads to the conclusion that the majority of the students do not just try to guess at the correct answers. Rather, many of them attempted the online MCQ exercises more than once to improve themselves indicating that they were interested in self-learning. Students also reported that they utilised search and inquiry skills that clearly showed motivated initiatives to plan how to overcome their weaknesses by independently looking for relevant resources, determine their own learning goals, and evaluate their own learning performance as a firm indicator of SDL development. Based on the findings, this study is able to refute the claim that MCQs are unable to cultivate independent learning skills."

At present madrasa education is still considered second class education. Besides, to improve the quality of madrasas can be started by improving the quality of the student national admission to all madrasas in Indonesia. This study aimed to trace the potential errors in the measurement results of Students National Admission of Madrasah Aliyah Negeri (SNPDB MAN-IC) 2020. Tracing was carried out on two aspects: i) Equality between test sets used based on evidence of test responses; and ii) Further tests on equality between question sets based on evidence of relationship between variables, taking into account the origin of the participating schools (MTs/JHS) and the origin of the participating regions (West, Central and East of Indonesia). This study involved 13,115 participants in 23 MAN-ICs throughout Indonesia in 2020. The materials tested comprised learning potential and academic ability (Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Social Studies, English, Arabic, and Islamic Religious Education). The study used achievement test with mathematics as a sample of test subjects. Based on the test response evidence, it was found that seven of the 15 questions were thought to have an indication of inequality between item sets. The results of tracing the evidence between variables indicated that it was the participants' origin of institutions that influenced the inequality between item sets. On the other hand, regional origin did not affect the inequality between item sets because the majority of participants came from the western region of Indonesia."

The program was designed to improve and promote the community’s reading habits in Buru Regency. This was a qualitative study aimed at describing the implementation of Gerakan Buru Membaca in Buru Regency. The research location was focused on Namlea District because of its relatively high population density and heterogeneity. Forty people were interviewed, and this number was obtained through purposive sampling. We employed an analysis technique proposed by Miles and Huberman. The results revealed that the reading movement received a positive response from the community and the village government, whose active role is implemented through the provision of village libraries, study rooms, and study houses of learning available. Furthermore, a mobile library, which was only available in the Namlea Village area, prioritized its services in open or public spaces. In other villages, however, the movement was still in the form of reading and learning spaces provided by the village government, with the participation of the community. Despite the positive response from the community, the movement still experienced several constraints."

Data were collected from 380 students from Kayonza and Gasabo Districts using a physics attitudes test. Findings illustrated that more than a quarter of participants felt that learning physics is boring. About 39% think that the subject of physics does not relate to the real-world experience. A significant number of participants had negative attitudes towards physics in terms of the effort required for learning. The findings also showed that the overall level for participants in physics problem-solving skills was low. The item-by-item analysis showed that the differences between responses of students from rural schools and their counterparts from urban schools in categories of problem-solving and physics concepts connections and understanding are statistically significant. It was found that many students in rural schools need to know more about the interpretation of a new equation to be able to apply it to a new physics problem."

Many studies show that cognitive conflict often occurs in learning and when solving mathematics problems. However, very few studies have looked at cognitive conflicts in solving mathematics problems, incredibly improper fraction problems. This study aims to analyze and describe students' errors in solving math problems using a commognitive perspective. The data was collected using a test sheet instrument, where students do the test think aloud. The answers on the student test sheets were analyzed by adjusting the think-aloud that was carried out, and then the interview process was carried out as a form of triangulation of the method in the study. The data analysis results show that there is a routine error that causes cognitive conflict when solving the improper fraction problem. The error that occurs indicates that the routine can and cannot resolve the cognitive conflict that occurs. This study's findings indicate the importance of routine procedures to be understood so that their use is appropriate for solving mathematical problems."

Essentially, the mental representations of learners are also affected by the sign vehicles employed to communicate ideas in the material world. Thus, any learning object also appears as a material representation, consisting of acoustic and visual forms, which affect its content. The human body’s kinesic modalities, spatial configurations (i.e., graphs, images), material objects, prosody, as well as the written and spoken word constitute the perceptual data that encode the concepts. This particular paper deals with the possibility that the more emphatic signifiers, i.e., the human body and material objects, can create narrative spaces and produce meaning during science teaching. It also discusses alternative uses of material objects along with the multiple interpretations their visual images can evoke. As regards the human body, iconic, deictic, and ergotic gestures are analyzed as forms that produce meaning and are autonomous and dynamic when working with the other semiotic systems. Both material objects and the human body rely upon the ability of the learners’ imagination to transport them to narrative worlds located outside the classroom."

Variety of ways and solutions to mathematical tasks and the tendency to type of students’ reasoning are explored through creative reasoning tests. Interview techniques by telephone are implemented to further explore the types of student reasoning (Local Creative Reasoning (LCR) or Global Creative Reasoning (GCR)). The results show that in comparison to MTs students, SMP students have more varied answers and ways to solve mathematical tasks. In certain cases; however, MTs students show some unique answers. The type of creative reasoning that students tend to use is of the LCR. These findings indicate the importance for mathematics teachers to design mathematics tasks that develop GCR-type creative reasoning. Examples and exercises in mathematics textbooks should also be directed at developing this type of creative reasoning."

Given that grade point average (GPA) may not be a reliable indicator for learning, some organizations have developed new types of assessment tools that measure generic skills, such as the Assessment of Higher Education Learning Outcome (AHELO) and the Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA). In Japan, an assessment tool called the Progress Report on Generic Skills (PROG) has been introduced to measure college students’ generic skills. However, the validity of this test has hardly ever been studied. This paper thus provides an opportunity to analyze the validity of PROG through statistical analyses of the correlation between PROG scores and GPA as well as interviews with students and instructors. The findings show a gap between PROG scores and GPA. Three possible reasons are put forth as explanations for such a gap: 1) PROG does not test generic skills properly; 2) the university does not nurture and/or assess students’ generic skills that PROG measures; and 3) students make different levels of efforts for PROG and college course work. The findings of this research suggest using the results of PROG only as a reference tool that needs to be triangulated with other assessment tools.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.11591/ijere.v3i1.5427"

Accordingly, a questionnaire based on Islamized principles of success (referred to as “Islamic character quotient inventory (ICQi)”) was correlated with CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Averages) of 343 students of Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto. The empirical testing indicates that the total score on ICQi correlated positively and significantly with the academic performance of the respondent. Students with either high or medium adherence to ICQi have a significantly higher CGPA than their counterparts with the low-adherence level. However, the result did not show a significant relationship between the CGPA of highly adherent individuals and that of those with medium adherence level. The findings of this research may suggest that Islamic principles are not confined to the spiritual aspect of human’s life, but also relevant and useful for our mundane affairs."

Underlying each reform, one can identify a rationality that surpasses the logic of Education, and is rather intertwined with the political project and ideological requirements of the government in office, or with certain socio-political junctures. The impact of the political world on education is particularly noticeable in school subjects that address National History. Within this perspective it is shown how, after institutional changes have occurred, different memories and visions about citizenship, democracy, conflict and nation are being promoted. This highlights different ways of subordination of the educational project to a wide universe of political dynamics.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.11591/ijere.v3i4.6795"
